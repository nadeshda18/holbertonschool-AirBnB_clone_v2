"""
Script that starts a Flask web application.

The web application must be listening on:
    - Address: 0.0.0.0
    - Port: 5000
Use storage for fetching data from the storage engine (FileStorage or DBStorage) => from models import storage and storage.all(...)
After each request you must remove the current SQLAlchemy Session:
    - Declare a method to handle @app.teardown_appcontext
    - Call in this method storage.close()
Routes:
    - /cities_by_states: display an HTML page: (inside the tag BODY)
        H1 tag: "States"
        UL tag: with the list of all State objects present in DBStorage sorted by name (A->Z) tip
            LI tag: description of one State: <state.id>: <B><state.name></B> + UL tag: with the list of City objects linked to the State sorted by name (A->Z)
                LI tag: description of one City: <city.id>: <B><city.name></B>
NOTE: You must use the option strict_slashes=False in your route definition
